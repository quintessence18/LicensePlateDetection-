# License Plate Detection and Character Recognition

## Background
This notebook provides documentation as to how I recreated a License Plate Detection program - utilising CNN, Yolo and OpenCV to detect and recognise a license plate and its characters. 

## Dataset
All of the data used has been provided below and in the notebook.
The repo provided explains where files should be moved for this project to work - However I will put out a general warning that this project uses certain depreciated functions of tensorflow. I plan to develop a more updated version in due course and will post my updates in this repo.
